This is a repository containing a very basic SQLite library for iOS. It allows for operating directly on an SQLite database primarily using strings. Internally it uses the SQLite C API.

The main purpose of "MVDatabaseMaintenance" is to prepare an SQLite database created outside of CoreData for use with CoreData. It utilizes the SQLite library and provides a decent example of its use.
